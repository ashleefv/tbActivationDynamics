## Overview
This model attempts to model the reactivation of a tuberculosis granuloma.
The model is built on top of a prexisting model by Sud et. al.
This model attempts to capture the upregulation of MMP-1 inside of a tuberculosis granuloma, the breakdown of collagen catalyzed by MMP-1,
and the movement of tuberculosis bacteria through the deteriated granuloma.

### Main files

* ModelTestScript.py
   Runs the model using the parameters in ColDet-model-parameters.csv and
   plots the results. The graphs are saved to jpeg files, and displayed when
   run using an ipython console
  
* k_Cgraphs.py
   Runs the model with varying values of k_C. This script produces graphs showing
   the effect of varying k_C on disease progression.
   
* TcellDepletion.py
	Runs the model for a brief period, and then gradually reduces paramters associated
	with the production of T cells. The script also produces graphs of the results of
	the model.
	
* GeneDeletionPaper.py
	Runs the model 3 times, each with a single gene deleted. Each of the genes
	deleted in the script are used to plot the different outcomes that can
	occur when a gene is deleted.

### Dependent & supplemental files

* ColDetModel.py
	This file contains the class containing the developed model.
	
* SimpleParallelFuncs.py
	This file contains functions written to make use of the Multiprocessing Python
	package easier to use.

* ImportParamFromFile.py
	Contains a function used to parse parameters from a .csv file.
	
* ColDet-model-parameters.csv
	Contains the model parameters that are read by ImportParamFromFile.py.
	Changes to this file change the parameters used in model runs.
	


   
## Example Usage
Run one of the scripts under main files to produce model output. To edit the
parameters of the model, open ColDet-model-parameters.csv in Excel or an other
spreadsheet or text editor.
